Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models.
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data.
Reinforcement learning learns through rewards and penalties.
Applications of machine learning include recommendation systems, fraud detection, NLP, computer vision, and predictive analytics.
